# landing-page-template
A landing page template about how to create a landing page - all the elements are here, you just need to fill them in.

## Using it
To use this, you just need to edit the html. If you want, you can change the colours by editing the $col variables in sass/lib/_variables.scss

The styling is within small partials and is highly re-usable - in most cases you just need to add different classes to the html.

## Colour scheme
The colour scheme of this landing page is based on the colour scheme of the European Implementation Collaborative's website - implementation.eu - which I was involved in developing.
